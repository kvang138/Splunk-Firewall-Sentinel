# Splunk Firewall Sentinel

## Introduction
In this project, I created a Splunk-based Firewall Monitoring Dashboard called Firewall Sentinel to provide security teams with clear, actionable visibility into network traffic and potential threats. The dashboard dynamically displays essential metrics over any chosen time window: total connections, allowed vs. dropped traffic, indicators of possible malicious intrusion attempts, and etc. To support deeper analysis, I implemented intuitive drill-down and filtering controls, allowing users to narrow down data by:

Geographic location (country → region → city) Firewall action (allow, block, drop, etc.)

This enables fast pivoting from high-level trends to specific events or suspicious connections streamlining threat detection, troubleshooting, and compliance reporting.

## Tools/Languages used.
- Splunk and SPL
- Python

## Conclusion
I created this Splunk Firewall Sentinel dashboard to provide comprehensive, at-a-glance visibility into firewall logs and network activity, enabling rapid detection of anomalies, policy violations, and potential malicious intrusions to strengthen perimeter security monitoring.
